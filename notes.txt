certain actions are prohibitively expensive eg. listing agents or checking nicknames for uniqueness.
check nick for uniqueness:
	get list of every account (4000)
	for each account:
		find the last nick: post (3000)
		
so for 10 users we are looking at 34000 musat
for 100 users we are looking at 30400 musat etc.
as the network grows these costs could become huge
	
	
instead we could build the initial list of nicknames
poll the database to find the highest post id (1004)
if the highest post_id is more than our last known post_id, request all posts since that point
scan the data and update nicks accordingly
