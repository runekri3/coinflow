coinflow
========

Phase 1 CoinFlow app for the netvend network

current commands are:

/add [seed value] - create a new agent (small initial funding supplied)

/login [seed value] - login to existing agent

/tip [address] - tip a user or post

/post [message] - post a message 

/history [address] - show the last 10 posts for the specified agent. If address is blank, the currently logged in agent is used

/nick - set a nickname for the logged in agent


More commands are coming as well as further functionality.
This software is just me finding out what netvend can do and messing around.
Don't trust it as it is fairly rough around the edges


It will require kivy <http://kivy.org> in order to work


Comments welcome
